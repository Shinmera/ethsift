    // Since in the implementation of EZSift (as in ours) the only use of the octaves is to pass and
    // extract the very first octave in the function "ethsift_generate_gaussian_pyramid", I suggest to kill 
    // the octave generation as a whole and simply just allocate space for the gaussian pyramid by 
    // "downsampling" the width and height of the image iteratively and simply pass the input image
    // to "ethsift_generate_gaussian_pyramid" instead of some octaves.
    
    // DIFF NOTE to EZSift: 
    // Original implementation in EZSift contained some upsampling cases which 
    // were used if it was enabled in the settings. Our implementation does not support upsampling
    // of the original image before processing.
    // Also some (seemingly) irrelevant divisions were left out in our implementation.
